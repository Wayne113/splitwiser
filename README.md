# splitwiser

SplitWiser is a simple, intuitive app that helps friends easily split bills, track shared expenses, and settle up quickly â€” perfect for meals, trips, and group activities.

Personally added functionality for service tax and charges in unequally split.

## How to use
1. Install any IDE for Flutter, e.g. VS Code, Cursor.
2. Run command below to meet requirements for installation and launch:
    ```bash
   flutter doctor
   ```  
3. Ensure Xcode is installed in order to install and launch in iOS devices (in my case); Android Studio for android devices.
4. Run and debug, wait SplitWiser to be installed.


ðŸ’¾ SplitWiser using SharedPreferences to store data locally, since it's developed for personal use to track expenses anywhere, no complex database needed!
