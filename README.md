# splitwiser

SplitWiser is a simple, intuitive app that helps friends easily split bills, track shared expenses, and settle up quickly â€” perfect for meals, trips, and group activities.

Personally added functionality for service tax and charges in unequally split.

## How to use
1. Install any IDE for Flutter, e.g. VS Code, Cursor.
2. Run command 'flutter doctor' to meet requirements for installation and launch.
3. Ensure Xcode is installed in order to install and launch in iOS devices (in my case); Android Studio for android devices.
4. Run and debug, wait SplitWiser to be installed.

ðŸ’¾ Kindly reminder, SplitWiser using SharedPreferences to store data locally, since it's developed for personal use to track expenses anywhere, no complex database needed!
